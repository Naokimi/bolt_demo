          Welcome to the Solidus Guided Tour. We'll take you through some of what we think makes Solidus special.

          Buckle up and get ready, and click the "Next" button on the right to begin!
      taxon_menu:
        button_action: continue
        button_location: /t/brand/solidus
        title: Taxon Menu
        selector: .categories #The selector for the object that will be highlighted
        body_text: |+
          We'll start with the navbar. Our default frontend automatically uses your taxonomy structure to create what you see here.

          While that's easy to manage, maybe you want to handle your navbar differently. Solidus prides itself on being infinitely extensible, so if you'd rather change what's displayed here - or even hardcode it in - it's all gravy, baby.

        title: Taxon Filtering
        selector: aside
        body_text: |+
          Diving more into the taxonomy, here's our filtering setup. From this widget, you can filter by any number of things - here, we've got price & category, and brands, but with minimal setup you can filter by whatever attributes you want.
  products:

      product_properties:
        button_action: next
        title: Product Properties
        selector: .product-properties
        body_text: |+
          Each product is special, and we wanted to give you an easy way to show them off. Here's where you can list out any relevant properties that the customer might want to see.

          You can adjust these easily on the admin side, we'll show that to you later.
      variant_selector:
        button_action: next
        title: Variants
        selector: .product-variants
        body_text: |+
          Variants are a great way to give your customers options, so we made it as simple as possible to create & manage as many variants as you need.
      images:
        button_action: continue
        button_location: /products?utf8=âœ“&taxon=&keywords=solidus
        title: Product Images
        selector: .product-page__images
        body_text: |+
          You want to show off your product, and your customers want to see what they'll receive. With Solidus, managing & storing your product images is simple.
    index:
      search_bar:
        button_action: continue
        button_location: /admin/orders
        title: Search Bar
        selector: .search-bar
        body_text: |+
          For the customers that know exactly what they're looking for, Solidus comes with a robust search feature out-of-the-box. Just like on a category page, you can filter through search results by any number of properties.

        title: Solidus Admin
        body_text: |+
          Behold, this is the Solidus admin UI.

          On the left, you'll see the main navigation bar. There you'll find all the resources you'll need to manage your E-Commerce store. You can even minimize the bar to make it less obtrusive.
      filtering:
        button_action: continue
        button_location: /admin/orders/R987654321/edit
        title: Filtering
        selector: "#table-filter"
        body_text: |+
          This is the order index page. You'll see a list of completed orders here, with some handy tools for finding the right one.

          Highlighted below is the filtering menu, where you can use properties like order number, completed date, or order status to find the orders that you're looking for.

          If you want to see user carts instead, you can uncheck "Only show completed orders".
