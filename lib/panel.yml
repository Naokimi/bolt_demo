    This is the order shipment page.

    You can see the shipments of an order and their status from this page.

    For unshipped orders, you can adjust what stock items are getting shipped in each shipment by using the "transfer" and "delete" buttons next to each line item. When the shipment is ready to go, you can click "Ship" to ship the package.

    At the top right, you have buttons for marking the order as approved, cancelling the order, or you can use the "resent" button to resend the order confirmation email to the user.
